## How do I setup the project?

1. Make sure you have ruby, node and npm installed.
2. Clone or fork the repo.
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm test` to make sure everything is working
5. Then inside VS Code, start the debugger (F5 for windows / Mac OS / Linux)
6. Then open up a C++ file, and any changes made to the project will show up in the syntax of that file.
7. Every time you make a change, just press the refresh button on the debugger pop up.
