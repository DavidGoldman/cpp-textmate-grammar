## How do I setup the project?
Make sure you have ruby and npm installed.
Clone or fork the repo.
Run `npm install`
Run `npm test` to make sure everything is working
Then inside VS Code, start the debugger (CMD + D for Mac, CTRL + D for windows)
Then open up a C++ file, and any changes made to the project will show up in the syntax of that file.
Every time you make a change, just press the refresh button on the debugger pop up.
