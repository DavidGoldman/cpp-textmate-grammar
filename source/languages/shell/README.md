# What does this do?
This enables your theme to better color your code. There are "textmate scopes" that your theme uses to apply color, this extension adds/improves the textmate scopes which should improve the way your code looks.

NOTE: The default VS Code theme does not color much. Use a theme like one of the following to benefit from the changes:
- Material Theme
- Noctis
- XD Theme
- One Monokai Theme
- Winteriscoming
- Popping and Locking

## How do I use it?
Just install the VS Code extension and the changes will automatically be applied to all relevent files.
