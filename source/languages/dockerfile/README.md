# What does this do?
This enables your theme to better color your code. There are "textmate scopes" that your theme uses to apply color, this extension adds/improves the textmate scopes which should improve the way your code looks.

NOTE: The default VS Code theme does not color much. Use a theme like one of the following to benefit from the changes:
- Material Theme
- Noctis
- XD Theme
- One Monokai Theme
- Winteriscoming
- Popping and Locking

## How do I use it?
Just install the VS Code extension and the changes will automatically be applied to all relevent files.

## What is different?

It adds:
- Shell command syntax
- Variables
- Image name/version/digest

## Contributing
If you'd like to help improve the syntax, take a look at `source/languages` and look at the `generate.rb` files. And make sure to take a look at `CONTRIBUTING.md` to get a better idea of how code works.
